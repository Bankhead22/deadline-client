<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This SPA was integrated using a [back-end](https://github.com/Bankhead22/deadline-api) api that allows a user to sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out. Once signed in, the user is able to create a new subscription, entering details such as name, price per month, start and end date, and comments on a form. The logic, user and subscription forms, and styling are handled locally on the client through my own code. Design was kept simple and straightforward to give users an uncomplicated and trouble-free experience. 

With a simplistic design in mind, I developed this [wireframe](images/deadline.jpeg) before starting on development. The repository for the back-end can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Bankhead22/deadline-api).
